Hi, my name is Ioannis Diamantidis!!

I am a polyglot software developer, living in Stockholm. I am self-motivated and I strive for being more efficient and becoming better every day in both my personal and professional life. Currently I am working as an iOS developer at Qliro Financial Services.

# Bio

Throughout my career so far I had the chance to work on a wide range of technologies, ranging 
from front-end and back-end development to building integrations, mobile apps and developing analytics pipelines. 
Working on so many different stacks and technologies helped me to improve my learning skills and my ability to adapt to different stacks quickly.


# Personal

On a personal level, I like playing and watching football and I am supporter of AEK Athens.
I also enjoy traveling to new places and learning about local history and culture.
In my spare time, I like to cycle (weather permitting), reading books, exploring new technologies on pet projects and going out for a coffee with some friends.

# Stack

Some technologies that I have worked with so far are: Swift, .NET Core, Docker, Kotlin, Java, Scala, Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Cassandra, Redis, Postgres, Python, PHP, Nginx, Drupal, Wordpress, Symfony, MySQL, Javascript, and Neo4j.
